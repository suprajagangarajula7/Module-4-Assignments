Q1. Role of Frontend (FE)
The Frontend (FE) is the part of a web application that users directly see and interact with in their browser.
1. User Interface (UI)
Frontend is responsible for designing and displaying the user interface.
It includes layouts, buttons, forms, images, menus, and colors.
Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue.
2. User Interaction
Handles user actions like clicking buttons, submitting forms, scrolling, and typing.
Provides instant feedback such as validation messages and animations.
Improves user experience (UX) by making the application interactive.
3. Communication with Backend
Sends requests to the backend using APIs (HTTP/HTTPS).
Receives data (JSON/XML) from the backend and displays it to the user.
Uses tools like Fetch API or Axios for communication.

Q2. Role of Backend (BE)
The Backend (BE) is the server-side part of a web application that handles logic, data, and security.
1. Server-Side Processing
Processes user requests sent from the frontend.
Executes business rules and application logic.
Generates responses and sends them back to the frontend.
2. Database Handling
Stores, retrieves, updates, and deletes data.
Communicates with databases like MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.
Ensures data consistency and integrity.
3. Security and Authentication
Manages user authentication (login, signup).
Handles authorization (who can access what).
Protects data using encryption, tokens (JWT), and secure APIs.

Q3. Business Logic
Business Logic refers to the rules and decision-making processes that define how a system operates according to business requirements.
Explanation
It determines what should happen when a user performs an action.
It is usually implemented in the backend.
It ensures the application follows real-world business rules.
Real-World Examples
E-commerce Website
Applying discounts only if the cart value is above ₹1000.
Calculating tax and final price.
Banking Application
Allowing withdrawals only if sufficient balance is available.
Charging penalties for minimum balance violations.
Online Booking System
Preventing double booking of seats or rooms.
Allowing cancellation only within a specified time.

Q4. Client–Server Model
The Client–Server Model is a network architecture where tasks are divided between clients and servers.
1. Client
The client is the user’s device (browser or mobile app).
Sends requests to the server.
Displays data received from the server.
Example: Chrome browser, mobile app.
2. Server
The server is a system that processes client requests.
Performs logic, accesses databases, and returns responses.
Example: Node.js server, Java server.
3. Communication Process
Client sends a request (HTTP/HTTPS).
Server processes the request.
Server sends a response back to the client.
Client displays the result to the user.

Q5. Three-Tier Architecture
3-Tier Architecture divides a web application into three logical layers.
1. Presentation Layer
Frontend of the application.
Handles UI and user interaction.
Examples: HTML, CSS, React.
2. Application (Business) Layer
Contains business logic and rules.
Processes user requests and applies logic.
Examples: Node.js, Java Spring, Django.
3. Data Layer
Manages data storage and retrieval.
Consists of databases.
Examples: MySQL, MongoDB.
Why 3-Tier Architecture is Used
Better scalability
Improved security
Easier maintenance
Clear separation of concerns

Q6. JavaScript as a Backend Language
JavaScript is widely used as a backend language due to its efficiency and flexibility.
1. Performance
Uses non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
Handles multiple requests efficiently.
Fast execution with V8 engine.
2. Ecosystem
Huge package ecosystem using npm.
Thousands of libraries and tools available.
Easy integration with frontend JavaScript.
3. Popular Backend Frameworks
Node.js – runtime environment
Express.js – lightweight web framework
NestJS – scalable enterprise framework
Fastify – high-performance framework
